# CS 330 Portfolio Submission: Computational Graphics and Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization course. It includes two components:
1. **3D Scene ZIP Folder**: A fully realized 3D world showcasing my skills in computational graphics.
2. **Design Decisions Document**: A detailed explanation of the design and development decisions made throughout the project.

These artifacts demonstrate my ability to create a 3D scene, apply computational graphics principles, and follow a structured development process. Below, I reflect on my approach to designing software, developing programs, and how computational graphics can help me reach my future goals.

## How Do I Approach Designing Software?

### **Designing Software**
- My approach to designing software starts with understanding the requirements and the problem space. I break down the project into manageable components and establish clear goals for each.
- This project helped refine my skills in applying computational graphics principles, such as lighting, textures, and transformations, to build a visually compelling 3D scene.

### **New Design Skills**
- I developed new skills in using OpenGL, including configuring multiple light sources and applying material properties to create realistic effects.
- I also learned how to design for usability by considering how different components of a 3D scene interact visually and functionally.

### **Design Process**
- My process involved:
  1. Researching and understanding the tools and libraries (OpenGL, shaders).
  2. Sketching out the scene layout and identifying key elements.
  3. Iteratively implementing and testing each feature (lighting, textures, transformations).

### **Future Applications**
- Tactics such as breaking down complex problems, iterating on design ideas, and applying visual principles can be used in any software development context, including user interface design, game development, and simulations.

## How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

### **Developing Programs**
- I approach program development systematically, starting with basic functionality and adding complexity incrementally. Testing and debugging are integral parts of my process.

### **New Development Strategies**
- This project required the use of shaders for rendering, which was a new experience for me. I learned how to use vertex and fragment shaders to control how objects are displayed on the screen.

### **Role of Iteration**
- Iteration played a significant role in refining the scene. For example, I adjusted light positions and intensities multiple times to achieve the desired effect. Similarly, I iteratively refined object positions and textures to enhance realism.

### **Evolution of Approach**
- Over the milestones, my approach evolved from a trial-and-error method to a more structured process. I became more efficient at identifying issues and implementing solutions, particularly with OpenGLâ€™s debugging tools.

## How Can Computer Science Help Me Reach My Goals?

### **Educational Pathway**
- This project deepened my understanding of computational graphics, which is essential for advanced topics like game development, virtual reality, and simulations. These skills will be useful in future coursework and research projects.

### **Professional Pathway**
- In a professional context, computational graphics skills can be applied in various fields, including:
  - **Game Development**: Designing realistic environments and effects.
  - **AR/VR Applications**: Creating immersive experiences.
  - **Data Visualization**: Representing complex data in 3D for better understanding.
- Additionally, this project improved my ability to work with large codebases, a critical skill in any software development role.
